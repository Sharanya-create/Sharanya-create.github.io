### This is My personal portfolio website

**The website template is adopted from www.templatefoundation.com**

This website is built for having my profile, to know concepts of RWD and learn hosting of website on github or forming github pages.

As per creative commons attribution 4.0 license this codebase can be cloned and used, altered and redistributed but credits must be given to the one from where the codebase is adopted. That is, if you clone this repo then you have to credit me fro creativity of emojis,extraa coding and alteration and for the template please give all credits to template foundation. I highly appreciate template foundation for providing such good templates free of cost and i give complete template credit to them.

this website/project is developed using HTML,CSS,JS web development languages.
Its suitable for students to build a creative profile of their own and if after cloning this repo if you are using even one alteration made by me, that is emoji, image in about.html then please in return give the credits to me as well as template foundation but if you do not use any of my alteration or extra code added then please give full credits to template foundation only orelse directly download template from their website. The image in the index page did not suit to all screens it was corrected by me so as to fit to all screens. If You don't use even that then its better to download from template foundation itself.

This website template clearly made me understand the concepts of responsive web development.
