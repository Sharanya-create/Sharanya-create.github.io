                <p class="scroll-animated-from-bottom">A Bucket List app is a web app that helps user(s) to list all their life goals that they want to fulfill before they kick the bucket. This is developed for both single and multiple user. Multiple user app is built on flask framework that interacts with Mysql data base. The details of the list that the user checks as done is stored on the client side,in local storage and list of goals on server side. I have used HTML5,CSS,JS,Jquery Ajax and python-jinja2 for this devlopement. Its not on RWD but the app for single user is made suitable for all screens(more better for large screens and mobile-desktop screen mode) using RWD concepts, as well as I had even hosted it on AWS-S3 for a week for my family and friends to test and had got a positive feedback. This mini-project made me understand web development in depth and also SD life cycle clearly. The main requirement I found for it is that, I had googled about Bucket list apps but of some i didn't like the UI and some where giving us option to select for goals and no option to add user opinions. To-do list can also be used for this purpose but i preferred to develop something in specific as it would even give me a lot of knowledge on web development. Bucket list for single user is used by my brother and data gets stored in local storage. I have not made use of any server here. It shares a similar UI with the home page of multiple user application. I have a built a To-do webapp as well with similar UI and development concepts.
